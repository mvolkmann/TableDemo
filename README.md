# TableDemo

This is a SwiftUI app that demonstrates using the `Table` view that was added in iOS 16.

Tables are mostly useless in iOS.
From the [Apple documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/table),
"On iOS, and in other situations with a compact horizontal size class,
tables don’t show headers and collapse all columns after the first.
If you present a table on iOS, you can customize the table’s appearance
by implementing compact-specific logic in the first column.
